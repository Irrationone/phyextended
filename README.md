## phyloch

This repository is simply to make available via GitHub the content of the
`phyloch` package written by Christoph Heibl (available 
[here](http://www.christophheibl.de/Rpackages.html)). This is mostly intended to
satisfy the dependencies of my packages and papers.

*I am not maintaining the code in this repository. If you find bugs, or have
suggestions on the code, please send them directly to the author of the package*
