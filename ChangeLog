IMPROVED FEATURES
    o box.clades() and box.tips() have been rewritten and work more
      cleanly now. Yet, they still support only directions 
      'rightwards' and 'leftwards' in phylograms. The argument 'align'
      in box.tips() has now an additional possible value ("tipwise"), 
      which now is the default.


      CHANGES IN PHYLOCH VERSION 1.5-1
  	

NEW FEATURES
    o Argument 'quiet' adde to mafft() and c.genes() to be able
      to suppress screen output by both funtions.

BUG FIXES
    o fixNodes() did not work on some ladderized trees. This is
      (hopefully) now fixed, but users are still encouraged to 
      report any peculiarities. A this stage it might still be 
      good to doublecheck if a unknown tree is manipulated for the 
      first time. (Thanks to Ingo Michalak and Johan Nylander for
      bug report.)  

NEW FEATURES
    o This ChangeLog is included.
    o The stratigraphic chart 2012 is provided for axisGeo();
      see ?strat2012 for details. (Thanks to Lars Nauheimer for 
      providing the data frame).
